# CV
This is my resume

# Why
Changing and updating a resume is annoying to deal with so I moved my resume online where the bounds of word processors don't apply.

# How
Content (model) has been decoupled from the HTML (view) allowing for updates to be simple and straight forward. The model and view are composed at build time using `gulp` so there is no runtime penalty.

# Building
Build with `gulp`. Run local server with `gulp server`.
